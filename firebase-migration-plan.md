# Firebase Migration Plan for Appily Agent

## Current Architecture
The codebase currently uses local file storage for:
1. Project metadata and conversation history (`data/projects.json`)
2. Project files (in `/temp` directory)

The key elements of the current storage architecture are:
- `StorageProvider` interface in `project-storage-service.ts`
- `FileStorageProvider` implementation for local storage
- `ProjectStorageService` which manages project data through a storage provider

## Migration Objectives
- Move project metadata storage from local JSON to Firebase Firestore
- Store generated project files in Firebase Storage instead of local filesystem
- Maintain local caching during generation for performance and reduced Firebase usage
- Ensure compatibility with the existing application architecture

## Migration Steps

### 1. Setup Firebase Project and Dependencies (Estimated time: 2 hours)
- Create a new Firebase project in the Firebase console
- Add required dependencies to package.json:
  ```
  firebase
  firebase-admin
  ```
- Create Firebase configuration files
- Update environment variables and .env template

### 2. Implement Firebase Storage Provider (Estimated time: 6 hours)

#### 2.1 Create Firebase Firestore Provider
- Create `src/services/firebase-storage-provider.ts` implementing the `StorageProvider` interface
- Implement CRUD operations for project metadata using Firestore
- Include proper error handling and data validation
- Maintain the same project structure format currently used

#### 2.2 Create Firebase Storage Service
- Create `src/services/firebase-file-storage.ts` for handling file operations
- Implement upload, download, list, and delete operations
- Include proper error handling and retry mechanisms
- Ensure file paths match the current structure for compatibility

### 3. Update Project Storage Service (Estimated time: 4 hours)
- Modify `project-storage-service.ts` to use the Firebase provider
- Add configuration options to choose between local and Firebase storage
- Implement graceful fallback to local storage in case of Firebase connectivity issues
- Update singleton initialization to use appropriate provider based on environment

### 4. Modify File Operation Service (Estimated time: 6 hours)
- Update `file-operation-service.ts` to work with Firebase Storage
- Create abstractions for file operations that work with both local and Firebase storage
- Implement local caching mechanism during project generation
- Add synchronization logic for updating files between local cache and Firebase

### 5. Implement Cache Management (Estimated time: 4 hours)
- Create `src/services/cache-service.ts` for managing local cache
- Implement TTL (Time To Live) for cached files
- Create background process for cleaning up expired cache files
- Add configuration options for cache size limits and expiration

### 6. Update Project Generation Flow (Estimated time: 5 hours)
- Modify `code-generation.ts` to use the new storage abstractions
- Implement logic to determine when to use local cache vs. Firebase
- Add hooks to sync local changes to Firebase when appropriate
- Update error handling to deal with Firebase-specific errors

### 7. Update Project Loading Flow (Estimated time: 3 hours)
- Modify `index.ts` to load projects from Firebase instead of local storage
- Update routes that depend on file system paths to work with Firebase URLs
- Implement streaming of file content from Firebase when needed
- Add progress tracking for large file operations

### 8. Implementation Testing (Estimated time: 8 hours)
- Create test cases for each Firebase integration component
- Test project generation with Firebase storage
- Test project loading and file operations
- Benchmark performance and optimize as needed
- Test error handling and recovery scenarios

### 9. Deployment Configuration (Estimated time: 3 hours)
- Update Dockerfile and deployment scripts
- Configure proper Firebase authentication in Cloud Run
- Set up Firebase Security Rules
- Test deployment in staging environment

### 10. Documentation and Cleanup (Estimated time: 3 hours)
- Update README.md with Firebase configuration instructions
- Document the new storage architecture
- Create rollback procedure in case of issues
- Remove any redundant local storage code after successful migration

## Implementation Details

### Firebase Configuration
We'll need to configure Firebase with:
- Firebase project ID
- Service account credentials for server-side operations
- Storage bucket configuration
- Firestore database settings

### Data Models
#### Firestore Collections
- `projects`: Stores project metadata (matching current ProjectEntry interface)
- `conversations`: Stores conversation history (potentially separated from projects for performance)

#### Firebase Storage Structure
- `projects/{projectId}/`: Root directory for each project
- `projects/{projectId}/files/`: The actual project files

### Local Caching Strategy
1. During project generation, files will be written to local filesystem first
2. After generation completes, files will be uploaded to Firebase
3. Local files can be cleaned up after successful upload or kept for a configurable period
4. When loading a project, files will be downloaded from Firebase to a local cache as needed

### Security Considerations
- Implement proper Firebase security rules
- Ensure service account credentials are securely managed
- Add rate limiting for Firebase operations
- Implement proper error handling for Firebase quota limits

## Backward Compatibility
To ensure backward compatibility during migration:
1. Implement a dual-read approach (check Firebase, then fall back to local)
2. Add a feature flag to control whether Firebase is used
3. Create migration utility to move existing projects to Firebase
4. Maintain support for local operations during development

## Estimated Timeline
Total estimated time: 44 hours (~2-3 weeks depending on resource allocation)

## Future Considerations
1. Implement user authentication and project ownership
2. Add real-time collaboration features using Firebase Realtime Database
3. Implement more sophisticated caching strategies
4. Add analytics for project usage and storage metrics
